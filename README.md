# WIMP-Project

The WIMP-Project is a comprehensive software system designed to [briefly describe the project's purpose, e.g., manage workflow, optimize data processing, or facilitate user interaction]. This project is highly modular and organized into several branches, each representing a different version or feature set.

## Branches Overview

The WIMP-Project is divided into multiple branches, each tailored to different functionalities or stages of development. Here are some of the key branches:

- **Main:** The main production-ready branch containing the latest stable version of the project.
- **Development:** This branch contains ongoing work and new feature development. It is updated frequently and might include experimental features.
- **Feature-X:** This branch focuses on the implementation of [specific feature X]. It may not be stable and is under active development.
- **Experimental:** Contains experimental features and prototypes that are not yet stable. This branch is used for testing new ideas and concepts.

## How to Get the Right Version

To ensure you're working with the correct version of the WIMP-Project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/WIMP-Project.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Move into the newly cloned directory:

```bash
cd WIMP-Project
```

### 3. List Available Branches

Check which branches are available in the repository:

```bash
git branch -a
```

This command will list all branches, including remote branches that you can check out.

### 4. Checkout the Desired Branch

To work with a specific branch, use the following command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you wish to check out (e.g., `development`, `feature-X`).

### 5. Pull the Latest Changes (Optional)

If you want to ensure you have the most up-to-date version of the branch, pull the latest changes from the remote repository:

```bash
git pull origin <branch-name>
```

### 6. Build and Run the Project

Refer to the project's build instructions in the `README.md` or `BUILD.md` file. Follow the steps outlined there to compile and run the project on your system.

## Development Guidelines

### 1. Always Include a `README.md`

For each new version or feature branch, developers must include an updated `README.md` file. This file should:

- Clearly describe the purpose and scope of the version or feature.
- List any prerequisites for running the project.
- Provide step-by-step instructions for installation, setup, and usage.

### 2. Include Build Instructions

In addition to the `README.md`, ensure that a `BUILD.md` file (or a dedicated section within the `README.md`) is included with:

- Detailed instructions on how to compile and build the project.
- Any environment variables, dependencies, or tools needed to build the project.
- Instructions for running tests and verifying that the build is successful.

### 3. Maintain Branch Consistency

When creating new branches, ensure that the `README.md` and build instructions are consistent and reflect any changes made in that branch. This helps maintain clarity and usability across all versions of the project.

### 4. Documentation Updates

Whenever a new feature is added or a significant change is made, update the documentation accordingly. This includes adding new sections to the `README.md` or revising existing instructions to reflect changes.
